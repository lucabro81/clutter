# Backlog — cross-cutting improvements

Ideas that emerged during development and do not belong to a specific block.
To be addressed when the context is mature, not necessarily in order.

---

## Before Block 4

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Dynamic prop map / custom components | The prop map is hardcoded for the POC. Open questions: where are new built-in components declared? How does a custom component (`component Card(props) {}`) map to token categories? Can the map be loaded from a file or must it always be Rust code? Discuss before Block 4. |
| Richer fixtures | `fixtures/` covers the basic cases. Add fixtures for real edge cases: props with complex expressions, `<each>` nested inside `<if>`, non-empty TypeScript logic blocks. |
| More robust recovery in `parse_props` | Recovery on a malformed prop advances to the next `Whitespace`. It could be more precise: skip to the token that clearly starts the next prop or closes the tag. |

## Block 4: Codegen

No todo file yet — open when ready to start.

## Before Block 5

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Error catalogue | Reference page documenting every error code (L001–L002, P001–P003, CLT101–107, W001–W002): cause, example snippet that triggers it, and suggested fix. |
| Benchmarks with `criterion` | No performance measurements yet. Add a benchmark on the lexer to establish a baseline and catch regressions. |
| Compiler API docs — evaluate | Assess whether a higher-level guide to the public API (`tokenize`, `Parser::new` + `parse_program`, `analyze`, future `codegen`) is needed beyond the existing `///` item docs. |

---

## Block 5: CLI

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| `miette` integration | `LexError`, `ParseError`, and `AnalyzerError` must implement the `miette` `Diagnostic` trait. |
| Multi-token span (`start..end`) | `Position` holds only `{ line, col }` of the start. A `Span { start: Position, end: Position }` would allow underlining text ranges in error messages (`miette` supports this natively). |
| `clutter-diagnostics` module (evaluate) | `LexError`, `ParseError`, and `AnalyzerError` share `{ code, message, pos }`. A shared `Diagnostic` trait + `emit` would reduce duplication and simplify `miette` integration. |

---

## Any time

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| `expect_emit` helper | `expect` currently returns `Result`; callers write `if let Err(e) = … { self.emit(…) }`. An `expect_emit` that emits and returns `Option<Token>` would reduce boilerplate where propagation is not needed. |
| `extract_identifiers` — shallow scan limitation | Known false negatives: destructuring (`const { a, b } = …`), imports (`import foo from …`), type aliases, closure variables. Acceptable for the POC; revisit when fuller TypeScript support is needed. |
